# Equity Status

##1.0 Product Overview
Equity Status is a web service that allows you to evaluate the performance of 4,892 publicly traded companies on the NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX stock exchanges. The evaluation methodology is adopted from Mary Buffet's book, 'The New Buffetology'. The system provides thirteen measures, eight quantitative and five qualitative, for use in your evaluation. Each quantitative measure has a target value. As you search for equities, the status of each measure's ability to meet its target is displayed along with the previous and expected returns.

###1.1 The Quantitative Measures
Financial data is collected for each company, calculations are applied and the values are saved. While using the system, these values are compared to the target values selected by you. If targets are met, a green dot is displayed for the measure. If the target is not met, a red X is displayed. Missing values are displayed as a white circles. Click on a row to get more information about a company. The quantitative measures provided by Equity Status include:

1. Previous Return on Investment (Previous ROI). This is found by obtaining the stock price 5 years ago, the current price and calculating the growth rate.

2. Return on Equity Average (ROEa). The annual return on equity (ROE) is collected and then the mean is found. The suggested target for ROEa is 12% or more.

3. Earnings Per Share Growth Rate (EPSi). The annual earnings per share (EPS) is collected and then the future value formula is applied to determine the growth rate of the EPS. The suggested target for the EPSi is 15% or more.

4. Earnings Per Share Volatility (EPSv). The Buffet methodology stresses the importance of a stable EPS growth rate. The methodology does not provide a formula, but a rough calculation was found for this measure. The calculation first finds the standard deviation of the EPS values from the last ten years. Then the difference of the first and last values is compared to three times the standard deviation and a ratio is established. The lower the ratio, the less volatile the the EPS. A target value of 1.5 or less is suggested.

5. Book Value Growth Rate (BVi). The annual book value (BV) is collected and then the future value formula is applied to determine the growth rate of the BV. The suggested target value is 5% or more.

6. Debt Ratio Average (DRa). The annual total debt ratio is collected and then the mean is calculated. The suggested target is 5 or less.

7. Shares Outstanding Reduced (SOr). The annual number of shares outstanding is collected. Then the value is found by subtracting the number of shares outstanding, from the current year, from the number of shares outstanding ten years earlier. The suggested target is 0 or more.

8. Expected Return on Investment (Expected ROI). To calculate the Expected ROI, the future value of the EPS in ten years is calculated from the current EPS value and the EPS growth rate. The mean value for the P/E ratio is also calculated. Next, the future stock price is found by multiplying the future value EPS by the mean P/E ratio. Finally, the expected ROI is found by using the future value function, the current stock price is the present value and the future value is the future stock price.


###1.2 The Qualitative Measures 
In addition to displaying the quantitative measures for each equity, a set of qualitative measures is also provided. The status for these measures are provided by you or someone in your group. By default, the status for each measure is undefined. Click on the row and a dialog is displayed that allows you to write notes for each measure and assign a status: Pass, Fail or Undefined. The sample measures provided include:

1. Is there a strong upward trend in the EPS?

2. Do you understand the product/service?

3. Has the product/service been consistent for 10 years?

4. Does the company invest in it's area of expertise?

5. Are few expenditures required to maintain operations?
